# FitnessDevicesArduinoBLE
This package provides simple Arduino sketches to publish bicycle and treadmill data over Bluetooth Low Energy. These preliminary sketches are not designed to be complete solutions for creating your own smart fitness devices, but rather a starting point that simplifies the data publishing portion. You are encouraged to fork these sketches and implement your own smart devices, calculating your own inputs and publishing them to be read by any other fitness system.

# Testing
These sketches have been tested with the [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-with-headers) and Zwift.

# Acknowledgements
The Bicyclino sketch is a modified version of the [ArduinoBLE-Cycle-Power-Service sketch](https://github.com/Tschucker/ArduinoBLE-Cycle-Power-Service) written by @Tschucker. The Treadmillino sketch was written to follow the same structure for easy clarity.
